Packages
    A package is a collection of modules organized in directories. Packages help you organize related modules into a hierarchy. They contain a special file named __init__.py, which indicates that the directory should be treated as a package.

    Example:

    Suppose you have a package structure as follows:

    my_package/
        __init__.py
        module1.py
        module2.py
    You can use modules from this package as follows:

    from my_package import module1

    result = module1.function_from_module1()
    In this example, my_package is a Python package containing modules module1 and module2.

How to Import a Package
    Importing a package or module in Python is done using the import statement. You can import the entire package, specific modules, or individual functions/variables from a module.

    Example:

# Import the entire module
    import math

# Use functions/variables from the module
    result = math.sqrt(16)
    print(result)

# Import specific function/variable from a module
    from math import pi
    print(pi)

    In this example, we import the math module and then use functions and variables from it. You can also import specific elements from modules using the from module import element syntax.

Python Workspaces
    Python workspaces refer to the environment in which you develop and run your Python code. They include the Python interpreter, installed libraries, and the current working directory. Understanding workspaces is essential for managing dependencies and code organization.

    Python workspaces can be local or virtual environments. A local environment is the system-wide Python installation, while a virtual environment is an isolated environment for a specific project. You can create virtual environments using tools like virtualenv or venv.

    Example:

# Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment (on Windows)
    myenv\Scripts\activate

# Activate the virtual environment (on macOS/Linux)
    source myenv/bin/activate
    
    Once activated, you work in an isolated workspace with its Python interpreter and library dependencies.
