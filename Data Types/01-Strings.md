STRINGS:

Built-in methods: 
    len() - for finding length 
    upper() - changing to upper case
    lower() - converting whole to lower case
    replace() - to replace the letter or words; Syntax(old_value, new_value, count)

String Manuplation and Formatting:
    Concatenation: You can combine strings using the + operator.
    Substrings: Use slicing to extract portions of a string, e.g., my_string[2:5] will extract characters from the 2nd to the 4th position.
    String interpolation: Python supports various ways to format strings, including f-strings (f"...{variable}..."), %-formatting ("%s %d" % ("string", 42)), and str.format().
    Escape sequences: Special characters like newline (\n), tab (\t), and others are represented using escape sequences.
    String methods: Python provides many built-in methods for string manipulation, such as split(), join(), and startswith().
