1. Regular Expressions for Text Processing:

    Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are a powerful tool for pattern matching and text processing. The re module in Python is used for working with regular expressions. 
    We use it by importing the re module, import re

    Common metacharacters: . (any character), * (zero or more), + (one or more), ? (zero or one), [] (character class), | (OR), ^ (start of a line), $ (end of a line), etc.

    Ex: 
    import re
    
    txt = "The rain in Spain"
    x = re.search("^The.*Spain$", txt)

    Examples of regex usage: matching emails, phone numbers, or extracting data from text.
    re module functions include re.match(), re.search(), re.findall(), and re.sub() for pattern matching and replacement.
